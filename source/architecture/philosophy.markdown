The philosophy of the Readium Web Components project is that it should be simple to build EPUB 3 support into web applications:

* Simple to embed EPUB publications in a web page.
* Simple to build custom EPUB-centric web applications.
* Simple to license for both personal and commercial projects. 
* Simple to deploy and maintain.
