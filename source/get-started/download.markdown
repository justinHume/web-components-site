## Versions
There are currently a few ways to get Readium.js. 

#### SimpleReadium.js
SimpleReadium.js is a single javascript file that contains the entire set of Readium.js modules. However, it provides a single, reduced, API for simple applications, or getting used to using Readium.js in your application. SimpleReadium.js is used in the [demo application](/Readium-Web-Components/get-started/use-it.html).

SimpleReadium.js can be downloaded in [minified gzip format](/Readium-Web-Components/downloads/SimpleReadium.min.js.gz) (20KB), or as a zipped [development version](/Readium-Web-Components/downloads/SimpleReadium.js.zip) (51KB). 

#### Readium.js
For the time being, Readium.js is available as both a [zipped set of .js module files](/Readium-Web-Components/downloads/Readium.js.zip) (54KB), and from [source](http://github.com/readium/Readium-Web-Components) on Github. An approach for production releases still needs to be determined.
