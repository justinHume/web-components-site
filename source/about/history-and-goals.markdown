### Inception and goals

The [Readium]() project started as a web-based demonstration of the [EPUB 3.0]() specification, released in XXXX. The goal of the project was to produce a simple web-based reader that implemented the majority of the new specification. 

### Success! Demonstrating an EPUB 3.0 web-reader

[Evident Point Software Corp.]() was contracted by the IDPF to build the reader and run the open-source project. During development and on completion, Readium was deployed as a server-hosted application, as well as a Google Chrome Packaged App. The packaged-app was a 100% dedicated client-side (browser) solution. This application, now with over 50,000 monthly users, allows users to load, read and save EPUBs.

### The next step

Having satisfied the goals of the original project, it was apparent that development tools were needed to support the development of EPUB 3.0-compliant readers. This need was made more pressing by the discontinuation of development on a new version of RMSDK, which does not support EPUB 3.0. 

#### Readium-SDK: High-performance industry-strength EPUB 3.0 for mobile and desktop

In light of the need for EPUB 3.0 software components, the [Readium Foundation]() was created to develop and manage the [Readium-SDK]() project. This project will produce a performant, mobile-focused, industry-strength EPUB 3.0 software development kit for open-source and commerical licensing. This is the spiritual successor to RMSDK for EPUB 3.0, and will set the standard for EPUB 3.0-compliant software.

#### Readium Web Components: Simple, light-weight, web-focused

In addition, the success of the original web-based Readium suggested a need to provide light-weight components for purely web-based reading systems. Evident Point Software, with an interest in web-focused readers, began to support the development of the [Readium Web Components]() project. RWC consists of a set of javascript modules that can be dropped into any new or existing web application, and can be composed to support a variety of different types of application.

### The future

The expectation is that Readium-SDK and RWC will develop in tandem to support EPUB 3.0 - both for high-performance native desktop and mobile applications, and as light-weight components for purely web-focused readers.
