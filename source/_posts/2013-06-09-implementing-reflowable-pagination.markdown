This post is about how reflowable pagination is implemented in Readium.js. 

## 
An issue was opened in the Readium.js [issue tracker]() about how reflowable pagination is implemented. This is a question that comes up every now and at one point I wrote up a basic example of how you can get HTML content to flow into either a single or side-by-side "page" layout. Since it has now come up again, I thought I'd make this example public and describe it in more detail. 

## What is _reflowable_ pagination?

Before we begin, you can get you the source for this example [here]().
