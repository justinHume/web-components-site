Welcome to the new Readium.js reference site and blog!

## Easy, open, web
Readium.js is a BSD licensed open-source project that makes it simple to build EPUB 3 web applications, or to embed EPUB 3 publications in web applications. 

<!--more-->

It's designed to be web-centric, light-weight and simple to use. The Readium.js library provides a set of javascript modules and APIs that can be easily added to any web project.

### The project & contributors
Readium.js is a project under the auspices of the [International Digital Publishing Forum]() (IDPF), developed and maintained by [Evident Point Software Corp.](). 

This project has [evolved](/Readium-Web-Components/about/history-and-goals.html) from the [Readium](http://readium.org) project. Readium was developed by [Matthew Robertson](https://github.com/matthewrobertson) and [Justin Hume](http://github.com/justinHume) at Evident Point Software under contract from the IDPF, with major contributions from [Benetech](http://www.benetech.org/literacy/bookshare.shtml), the [DAISY Consortium](http://www.daisy.org/home) and [others](https://github.com/readium/readium/contributors).

### Start building and developing!
Readium.js is currently in Beta, but we're hoping to move things along quickly, stabilize the API, and add features. Feedback on any aspect of this site, or [Readium.js](http://github.com/readium/Readium-Web-Components) is very welcome. If you're interested in contributing, there is a long list of things to do and I'd be eager to walk you through it. 

You can get in contact with me through the Readium.js [issue tracker](https://github.com/readium/Readium-Web-Components/issues), by email at justinh@evidentpoint.com, or through [Github](http://github.com/justinHume).

Otherwise, take a look around the site, and give Readium.js a try!
